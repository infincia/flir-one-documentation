# FLIR One Documentation

This repository is intended to be unofficial documentation on interacting with
the FLIR One hardware.

Inspired by a [similar effort by lod](https://github.com/lod/seek-thermal-documentation) for the Seek Thermal hardware.

Documentation is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/infincia/flir-one-documentation/wiki)
